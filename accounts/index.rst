Requesting an account on UR's HPC
====================================

Faculty Accounts
-------------------

Please send your request to ``hpc+account@richmond.edu``, and we will add 
you as immediately as possible. There are two places where you will get 
an account, ``spdrweb`` and ``spydur``. The first is the webserver where
these pages appear and where we host applications like RStudio that are
accessed through webpages and pseudo-webpages. The second is the high-performance
cluster.

Your account will remain active for as long as you are on the faculty.

Student Accounts
-----------------------

Requests made by faculty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the above procedure, and include the netIDs of the students
for whom you are requesting accounts. Because we keep usage statistics
to find out how, when, and by whom Spydur is used, please give us the
name of the class, and the date when the class ends, or a date beyond the
end of class when you would like us to suspend the account. 

Requests made by students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally speaking, the faculty member associated with your work will 
have made the request already. But if you do not seem to have an account
at all, contact your faculty sponsor. If you are having trouble logging in
(example: your password doesn't work), send a message to ``hpc+help@richmond.edu``.
