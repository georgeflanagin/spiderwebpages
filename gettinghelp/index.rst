Help!
====================================

Specific
-------------

Let's look at the example where you have a specific problem: you have tried
to do something, and it fails catastrophically, leaving you with a long winded
error message. In this case:

- Pack up all the relevant information, such as the transcript of what you were doing, and any input data files that are involved.
- Send a message to ``hpc+helpme@richmond.edu``.

General
------------

This site is indexed, and the search box (upper left side of the pages) works for
the whole site, not just the page you are on. Cool, eh? Broadly speaking, we have
a few long discussions about common topics about which people need help.
