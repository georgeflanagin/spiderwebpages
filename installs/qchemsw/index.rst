Q Chem
====================================

The instructions for installation are provided on the 
`Q-Chem website <https://www.q-chem.com/install/#linux>`_. 
At least until the license info, it is particularly simple::

    wget -N https://downloads.q-chem.com/qcinstall.sh
    chmod 700 qcinstall.sh
    ./qcinstall.sh

Installation is done over the network. The ``qcinstall.sh`` file is
quite small, and invokes a lengthy installation.
